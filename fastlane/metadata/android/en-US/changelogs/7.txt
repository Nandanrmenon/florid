Thank you for the 100 ⭐️ on GitHub! It means a lot to me ❤️. Your comments have been amazing and I am glad that you are enjoying the app.
## New Features
- [MAJOR] Background fetching of repository and updates is now available. You can enable it from the update settings screen. It will check for updates in the background and show a notification if any updates are available. It will also fetch repos in the background to keep the app up to date. Don't forget to allow the app to run in the background and ignore battery optimizations for it to work reliably.
- You can now favourite an app by tapping the heart icon on the app detail screen. You can view all your favourite apps in the new "Favourites" tab on the update screen.
- Export and import your favourite apps list as a JSON file. You can find this option in the settings screen.
- Group and display permission's description instead of raw permission name.
- Added support for Czech(cz) Langauge
