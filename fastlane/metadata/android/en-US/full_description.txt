Florid is basically F-Droid client, but better looking? This project started out as a hobby or you can say an experiment. This app should be able browse, download & update apps from F-Droid. You might have a question, isn't there other client that does the job? Yes, but this is my take on the application from a UX designers perspective. This project would be UX first priority for me, so don't mind leaving your feedbacks on Github. This project might expand to allowing other repos like IzzyOnDroid.
